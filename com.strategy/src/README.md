The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a group of related algorithms, encapsulates each one in a separate class, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the client that uses it, enabling behavior changes at runtime without altering existing code.

Encapsulates different algorithms or behaviors into separate strategy classes.
Allows dynamic selection or switching of algorithms at runtime.
Promotes flexibility and reduces conditional logic in the code.
