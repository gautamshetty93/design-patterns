## 📌 Observer Pattern

This module demonstrates the Observer Pattern in Java, where a subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them automatically whenever its state changes.
Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that creates a one-to-many relationship between a subject and its observers. When the subject's state changes, all dependent observers are notified and updated automatically, ensuring synchronized communication.

The example simulates a YouTube channel and its subscribers. When a new video is uploaded, all subscribed users receive a notification. This pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers and is commonly used in event-driven systems, messaging frameworks, and UI listeners.
